It's December 2023 and Google has made their Gemini API available for free to us tinkerers. Here you'll find information to quickly get up and running with a gradio chatbot using the Google's API. At the link below, Google provides a link to get yourself an API key. It's a good idea to add the key as an environment variable as done here in this code.

Python libraries:

Be advised, gradio does not work with Python 3.12, I used 3.9, which worked great.
